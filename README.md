# sports-reference-clone data repo

In order to create a clone front-end for sports-reference.com I needed something to pull the data from.

After downloading all of the nesecarry tables off sports-reference since they block web scrapers, this project stores csv data sheets in mongo so that the front end can use mongo

## Pre requisites

A running mongoDB instance that you can connect to

Included data for the following sports for the last 5 seasons

- NFL
  - AFC / NFC Standings data
  - Team Schedule data

- NBA

- NHL

- MLB
