# sports-reference to JSON

This project originally started as using the open-source API [sportsipy](https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy) in attempt to pull data and export it in JSON format. Unfortunately, sportsipy was decomissioned and no longer functions to pull data.

Sports-reference allows you to export tables as CSV or Excel workbook and this project now aims to parse those exports and generate JSON files of the same data.

## Available exports

### NFL

- Conference standings (AFC/NFC)

### NBA

### NHL

### MLB

## Running

See docs for each sport on how to run their modules.
